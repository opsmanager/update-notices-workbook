* How to parse? - see parse.rb
* process each log entry... (git log after sha --pretty='%s%b') (subject and body)
* Developers will need to adhere to blank line 2 commit standards. release-note tags can ONLY appear in body (line 3 >=)

* rake release-notes:generate > create release-notes.md for editing / commit to docs/release-notes.md

* Timestamp will be generated by deploy to production

    - check age of release-notes.md vs the available current finishes / release-note tags commits.
        - notify operator that there are more recent finishes/release-note tags if applicable
    - If commits confirm is OK - deploy processes release-notes.md and preview HTML to operator for confirmation
    - If preview confirm is OK - deploy flags upload to S3 is ok ... set pathname to /release-notes/$timestamp
    - deploy generates - version.js & version.rb (or appropriate alternative injection of version/timestamp number into client and server code)
    - if newly generated files diff then create a deployment/version numbering update commit first.
    - carry on and push deployment + upload release-notes/$timestamp.html

- Client app shows Bootstrap alert when a new version is first loaded
* How not to display? - User has latest_release_seen = nil | timestamp ()
